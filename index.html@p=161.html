your transponder from mode C to mode A. You can leave the transponder on mode C. It just means that the "A" part of the transponder (which holds the code) must be set accordingly.</li></ul></li></ul><p>· Signals in the event of an interception</p><ul><li>Signals made by interceptor<ul><li>Rocking wings and flashing navigation lights irregularly followed by a slow turn: YOU HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED, FOLLOW ME</li><li>Abrupt break from aircraft: YOU MAY
